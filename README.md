# Project-01.-Heart-Disease-Prediction
Overview
This project focuses on the development of a predictive model for heart disease. The model aims to utilize machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of an individual having heart disease based on various health-related factors and medical attributes.

Objective
The primary objective of this project is to create a reliable and accurate prediction model that can assist in early detection of potential heart disease. By analyzing a set of input features, the model will provide a predictive report of whether or not a person has a healthy heart or not.

Features
The heart disease prediction model takes into account various features that are commonly associated with heart health. Some of the features include:

Age
Gender
Blood pressure
Cholesterol levels
And more...

Model Development
The model is developed using machine learning algorithms and techniques, with a dataset containing historical medical records and their corresponding heart disease diagnoses. The dataset has been preprocessed, cleaned, and prepared for training the predictive model.

Technology Stack
Python
Machine Learning Libraries (such as Scikit-learn)
Data Analysis Tools (Pandas, NumPy)
Colab Notebooks or other development environments

Usage
The model can be utilized via a Python interface or integrated into a web application. Users can input their medical data or relevant health attributes to obtain a predictive result indicating their risk of heart disease.
